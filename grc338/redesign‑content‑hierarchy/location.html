    <h3>History of Solvang, CA</h3>
    
   <p>Solvang was founded in 1911 by three members of a group of Danish educators, whom a year earlier had formed the Danish-American Corporation. The plan of the three was to establish a Danish village, where the arts, crafts and customs of their homeland could be created anew, and to build and staff a Danish Folk School, similar to those which were so successful in Denmark. These three educators were Rev. J.M. Gregersen, Rev. B. Nordentoft and Peter B. Hornsyld, all from Iowa.</p>
    
    <p>Entranced by the natural beauty and ideal climate, as well as finding the soil fertile and the water supply adequate, they purchased 9,000 acres of the old Spanish land grant, Rancho San Carlos de Jonata.Old Mission Santa In., which had stood so long by itself on this remote mesa, was to begin seeing great changed with the birth of the village of Solvang. (In English: "Sunny Meadow".)</p>
    
    <p>After three years in a simple two-story frame building downtown, the Danish pioneers in 1914 constructed their Folk school three stories high, on El Monte Calzada, a hill on the northerly edge of the Village. Named Atterdag College (translated: "There'll Be Another Day"), the tide carried a strangely prophetic message into the future. For both the Solvang Lutheran Home (1953), and the Santa Tn. Valley Recovery Residence (1977), were to replace the abandoned, decaying building on the hill.</p>
    
    <p>"Discovery" by visitors to Solvang in the late 1940's gave the Valley a year-round economic boost through the many phases of tourism, to the irrigated crops of today, including the vast vineyards that supply grapes for over 30 wineries.</p>
    
    <p>Agriculture has been generous in the Valley — From the wild, open rangeland grazing of cattle and sheep, Here, also, horse ranchers and breeders continue to find that right acreage for their prized horses.Latest official estimates of population: Valley at 20,000, and Solvang 5,500. Climate: It's the best, year round, in California.</p>
