<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>          
<h2>Introduction</h2>           
<p>ZaraBella</p>
<p>One by one, we are leading a movement to a future where all beauty is clean beauty. We are powered by people, and our collective mission is to get safer products into the hands of everyone. Formulate, advocate, and educate—that’s our motto for creating products that truly perform while holding ourselves to unparalleled standards of safety. Why? It’s really this simple: beauty should be good for you. </p>
            

    
<h2>Target Audience</h2>  
<p>People who are likely to be customers of ZaraBella fall within a few main categories. Firstly, customers will be predominantly female. As more science and resrearch has come out about clean cosmetics, they have really popularized with the younger generations such as millenilas and Gen Z. Additionally, many moms would be likely to purchase our products as they tend to want only the cleanest products to be coming in contact with their children. Lastly, it is more likely that middle to upper class women would be purchasing these products as they will be more expensive than the average drugstore because of their natural ingredients.</p>
           
<p>Again as a lot of research has developed on cosmetics over the years, people are becoming a lot more conscious of exactly what is in their products. Many are turning to all natural ingredients in efforts to take the best care of their skin as possible. Therefore this target audience's main goals are to use clean products that really work. </p>
